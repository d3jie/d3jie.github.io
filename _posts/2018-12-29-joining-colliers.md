There has been lots of change in 2018 but this has been a biggie. After almost six years, a lot of phone calls, many late nights, my first IPO, quite a lot of flying and of course learning to speak American it was the right time to change things up and move on from Cushman. Those six years hold some fantastic memories and my time at Cushman & Wakefield was an incredible learning experience, every day held a new challenge which continued to push me outside of my comfort zone. Aside from all the things achieved the biggest and more prominent highlight will be the people I met and worked with along the way.

My move to Colliers is a big step up in seniority and is my first venture outside of Enterprise Networking - an exciting challenge. In my new role as a Solution Architect I will be supporting Colliers International’s M&A strategy by leading technology integration, an important role to facilitate business growth. Since joining it has been a busy few months preparing to start 2019 running and in the last week of December we were very pleased to have approval for the first major project. So, here’s to the next chapter in my CRE career! 🥂
