My name Aanuoluwa Otitoola.

Iâ€™m a geology major turned software developer.
Ever since I first learned how to program while taking an introductory computer science course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career.
I started my career a cognitive software engineer building enterprise applications and data processing systems using Java and Python.

I have worked on different software deployed to a wide range of customers in the banking and telecommunications industry.

More recently, I decided to pursue an advanced degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Liverpool, UK.

Besides programming and doing AI stuff, I enjoy playing Chess and love reading.
