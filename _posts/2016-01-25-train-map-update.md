I'm sure regular followers of my blog are aware of my [Rail Map](/menu/railmap.html) (well, it's National Rail's map really), it shows all of the railway lines in the UK which I have travelled on at some point. Both a record for where I have been in the UK and a challenge to travel the entire network! 

The last update I made to the map was in 2013, which is a shockingly long time ago. I have just invested some time adding journeys made since then. Won't list them all off but some of the highlights are:

- London to Sheringham (a beautiful seaside town) via Norwich 
- London to Bristol Temple Meads, past the impressive architecture of Bath Spa
- St Erth to St Ives, one of the most famous and stunning branch lines in the country
- Plymouth to Gunnislake, another great scenic branch line 
- London to Weymouth

I'll do my best to keep up with the updates, the process is much more well rehearsed now. Myself and @geekyjames are also planning a tour of Scotland by rail in the next few weeks, so there will be so blog posts following that journey no doubt!
